        <h2>
            You can't become a real Vatista player until you can do two crouching As into a crouching C, cancel crouching C into a standing B and start holding up, which will jump cancel the standing B, allowing you to perform a jumping B whilst still holding up, which lets you get the charge for the A version of Trāns Volāns - then you have to keep holding the B button during Trāns Volāns, pick up with another crouching C (which you then have to hold) when Vatista lands, and cancel it into a crouching B Si Deus Fragmentum set. After that, you have to link a crouching A and cancel it into crouching B (whilst still holding A) to detonate the low B Si Deus Fragmentum, then whilst the opponent is being launched, you have to release the C button to set a crouching C Si Deus Fragmentum, and then catch the opponent with a standing B as they fall down, which will detonate the low C Si Deus Fragmentum. During the explosion of that C Si Deus Fragmentum, you have to cancel standing B by letting go of A and setting a standing A Si Deus Fragmentum, which will be detonated by the previous explosion, giving you time to hold up and link a jumping C, which you should hold as you cancel it into another A Trāns Volāns (even though doing crouching B, cancelling it into crouching BB, and cancelling that into crouching BBB would be a better ender) before you release the C button you were holding to set a final crouching C Si Deus Fragmentum for oki. If you can't do that, you're not a real Vatista player.
